# cowin-bot

Why this bot?

This bot was created for the sole purpose of finding vaccination slots at a PIN Code. Cowin is a Government of India portal to book your COVID-19 vaccination slots. However, the issue was - the slots were getting booked in a matter of minutes. This bot was created to notify the user when the slots open.

This bot uses python-telegram-bot module to communicate with the telegram bot servers. The BOT_TOKEN has to be added in telebot/creds.py

The user data is stored in a simple list, so the data is not persistent. Necessary changes of connecting to a database can be done.
